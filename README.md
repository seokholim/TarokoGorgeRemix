# Taroko Gorge Remix

My remix of Taroko Gorge. The original can be found on Nick Montfort's website: https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/

It asks for a keyword, then it will generate a poem with word choices that are closest to the keyword (word similairty is computed by Glove)

## How to run it

It's simple. In the folder directory, run:

```bash
python app.py
```
And go to localhost:5000
